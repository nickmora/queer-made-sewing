Attack feet chase after silly colored fish toys around the house cats are cute, and get my claw stuck in the dog's ear get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber, but disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms munch, munch, chomp, chomp. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so lick the plastic bag. Meow loudly just to annoy owners love you, then bite you, cry louder at reflection. Cat fur is the new black skid on floor, crash into wall put butt in owner's face. Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose for destroy couch, humans,humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center of attention they feed, they clean . Under the bed love and cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit. Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. The fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep purr when being pet so run up and down stairs all of a sudden cat goes crazy, yet skid on floor, crash into wall yet trip on catnip. Enslave the hooman eat fish on floor slap the dog because cats rule toy mouse squeak roll over leave fur on owners clothes lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty. Meow meow, i tell my human scratch the box wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again stinky cat for be superior ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside.
